# codingTasks

-task name: Periodic Table
-description(what it does, why learning this aspect of coding is important):
-a table of contents to allow other people to quickly navigate expecially long or detailed READMEs:
-if needed, included an installation section that tells other users how to install your project locally
-include a usage section that instructs others on how to use your code after they've installed it. Including screenshots of what your program does.
-a section for credits that highlights and links to the authors of your code (in this case it should be only you, but this is good practice for a professional role where you are likely to work in a team of developers).
