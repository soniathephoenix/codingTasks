- ### Task name: Periodic Table
- ### What it does

The task involves creating a responsive periodic table using HTML and CSS. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - The HTML file contains the structure of the periodic table. It includes elements for each chemical element, typically represented with `<div>` tags or `<table>` rows and columns.
   - Each element includes attributes such as atomic number, symbol, and name, structured in a way that mirrors the traditional periodic table layout.

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - The CSS file is responsible for styling the periodic table. It ensures that the elements are displayed in a grid format, similar to the actual periodic table.
   - The CSS includes styles for various screen sizes, using media queries to make the table responsive. This means the table adjusts its layout for different devices, such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
   - Styling details such as colors, spacing, and fonts are defined to make the table visually appealing and easy to read.

### Why learning this aspect of coding is important

1. **Fundamental Web Development Skills**:
   - Learning to create and style web pages using HTML and CSS is foundational for web development. These skills are essential for anyone aspiring to build or maintain websites.

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Creating a responsive design is crucial in todayâ€™s multi-device world. Understanding how to use CSS media queries and flexible layouts ensures that web content is accessible and user-friendly on any device, from large desktop monitors to small mobile screens.
